function [ e,h ] = pointJox(omega,thickness_list, epsilon_list,kx_list,soucePosition)
%This function calculates the flux when source jox is placed at a given point
%   omega:          frequency
%   thickness_list: thickness of every layer, should start and end with Inf
%   epsilon_list:   epsilon for every layer, complex vector
%   sourcePosition: where the source is. Origin point is put at the upper
%                   surface of layer 1
