function Flux = calJoy(omega,thickness_list, epsilon_list,kx_list,targetLayer,sourceLayer)
%This function calculate the heat flux for souce joy
%   omega:          fequency, scalar 
%   thickness_list: thickness from layer 1 to N, should start and end with
%                   Inf, vector
%   epsilon_list:   complex vector, containing epsilon for every layer
%   targetLayer:    at which layer that you can to calculate the flux, should
%                   be a lossless layer
%   sourceLayer:    at which layer source is placed, should be a lossy layer
