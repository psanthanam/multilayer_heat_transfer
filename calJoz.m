function Flux = calJoz(omega,thickness_list, epsilon_list,kx_list,sourceLayer,targetLayer,isLossy)
%This function calculate the heat flux for source joz
%   omega:          fequency, scalar 
%   thickness_list: thickness from layer 1 to N, should start and end with
%                   Inf, vector
%   epsilon_list:   complex vector, containing epsilon for every layer
%   sourceLayer:    at which layer source is placed, should be a lossy layer
%   targetLayer:    at which layer the flux is calculated, should be a
%                   lossless layer
%   isLossy:        a vector containing 1 and 0 indicate whether a layer is
%                   lossy
